SRAEE is a collab mod (b̶e̶t̶t̶e̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶n̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶m̶u̶n̶i̶t̶y̶ ̶r̶e̶m̶i̶x̶,̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶i̶n̶f̶o̶r̶m̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶) made by sunsetquasar and Ewan, and started December 6th, 2018.

== Gameplay ==

Mostly the same as vanilla SR, same stats, custom weapons, etc. etc.
Priest has a 3rd AGI aura for MAG, while now you can get +0.3 RANGE per STR, DEX and MAG.

== Weapons and Compos ==

Unlike vanilla SR, each set of weapons (from the first LVn weapon to the last LVn weapon) has 5 weapons, istead of 4, and all classes have all elemental types.
Expect some compos that didn't exist in some levels (e.g. vampire's card 2, knockback's card 6, quick's card 6) to be in this mod.

== Classes ==

All 8 classes as usual, but with a 9th class, sorcerer.
Sorcerer is a Magical class and its purpose is to be a glass cannon.
It is overall very strong, but HP scales poorly.
It also has the overdrive function, which after charging up its attacks, it enters an overdrive state, with increased AT and decreased AGI.
SP Investiments:
LP = LP + 6
STR = overdrive AT boost + 1% (can't go over 150%), overdrive AGI boost + 0.5% (can't go over 70%), LP + 0.5
DEX = AGI - 1-1 (can't go below 40-50), Range + 0.5, LP + 0.5
MAG = Min AT + 1/3, Max AT + 1/2, LP + 0.5
OC - Overdrive Charge - number of attacks before entering overdrive
OT - Overdrive Time  - time for overdrive to end after it's triggered
OVERDRIVE (AT) XX% (AGI) YY% - the boost that overdrive gives, being + XX% AT and -YY% AGI

== The Map ==

The map is a bigger map not horizontally, but vertically. The stage placement and advancement are also very different:
In the first world, you have many paths to go to more than one world, and there's not a single path to go, plus you don't have to beat any megabosses to travel to other worlds, as the 1st world's megaboss is at the middle of the world area.
Note: clicking the map scroll area makes it scroll 1.5x faster.

=== Attention ===
